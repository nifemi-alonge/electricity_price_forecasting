# EPF

Coding exercise using machine learning to forecast GB hourly day-ahead electricity prices for 2020

## Description

**Possible approaches:**
- ARIMA models
- Regression (linear, XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Deep learning (RNN, LSTM)

**Final approach:**
- Linear regression

## Dependencies

* The code was written in a Google Colab Notebook (compatible with Jupyter Notebook).
